Q: How do I get help documentation?
A: /ahelp for general amnesiac help, /ehelp to see what other help commands
   are available.
   NOTE: We need a better help system. Think you can do it? Come talk to us
   on EFNet #amnesiac.
   NOTE: see amn/docs for further documentation.
   NOTE: see http://www.prbh.org/help/ also ~help/ for epic specific help.

Q: How can I contribute?
A: We need documentation and testing. Come to EFNet #amnesiac if you find
   a bug. Even better if you can isolate it and provide a patch. If you
   write some documentation come to #amnesiac to get it comitted into the
   tree, if you used cvs to grab amnesiac, you can create recursive diffs
   (patches) for amnesiac: cd ~/amn && cvs -q diff -auR > amnesiac.patch

Q: Where can I get help?
A: The official amnesiac channel is on EFNet, #amnesiac. Don't ask if anyone
   is around, just ask your question. If no one can answer it right away then
   idle, someone will be around eventually.

Q: How do I switch channels?
A: Hit ^X to switch between channels and queries for the current window

Q: How do I make this look less gay?
A: /theme to see a list of themes, /theme <name> to switch themes. You can
   also change individual formats with /format.

Q: How do I load and unload modules?
A: /addmod to load a module, /delmod to remove a module, /listmod to see
   what's loaded, /vmod to see all the modules available. /emod to see more 
   detailed description about the module.

Q: How do I use windows?
A: /wj to join a channel in a new window, ^Wc to create a new window, ^Wn to
   move to the next window, ^Wp to move to the previous window, ^Wk to kill
   the current window, ^W<0-9> to switch to the specified window, /<0-9> to
   switch to the specified window. esc<0-9> to switch to specified window.
   /wk to kill current window.
   NOTE: We need better documentation on this. Any volunteers?
   NOTE: see also /winhelp

Q: How do i create a window dedicated to msgs?
A: /mw -hidden|split|kill [num] <-- this should be self explanatory.

Q: Where is the annoying ambiguous nickcomplete feature?
A: Under a ideal world we would like to see users use tab to complete
   nicks in publics, whilest appending a : at the end of the specified
   completed nick. i.e if user crapple is in current channel, do
   hi cra<tab> which will complete the nick crapple or, cra<tab> : which
   usually completes the nick in question usually with a greater chance
   of accuracy, for those who want's the old nickcomplete and all of it's
   broken glory. /addmod ncomp to load the nickcomplete module /format r
   while choosing your poison don't forget to /save to keep your changes.

Q: What's the best way to change behavior that I don't like?
A: First, see if there's a /format or a /config for the behavior you want
   to change. If not, take a look at amn/modules/vanilla for an example
   of how to write a module to set behavior you like. or if its a simple
   alias of minor things put it in your ~/.epicrc

Q: How do i use notify?
A: /notify to view online/offline nicks if any.
   /notify nick will add specified nick to notify list.
   /notify -nick will remove specified nick from notify list.

Q: How do i ignore someone, what do the types mean?
A: /ign nick <type> if specified nick is online else
   /ign *!ident@*.isp.com <type>
   /tig to remove ignores.
   Some common ignore types. taken from epicsol.org's page.
   ctcps      filter in/out all CTCPs received
   invites    filter in/out all INVITEs received
   msgs       filter in/out all MSGs received (but not CTCPs)
   notes      filter in/out all NOTEs received
   notices    filter in/out all NOTICEs received
   public     filter in/out public channel conversation
   wallops    filter in/out operator WALLOPS
   topics     filter in/out all TOPIC changes
   nicks      filter in/out all NICK changes
   joins      filter in/out all channel JOINs
   parts      filter in/out all channel PARTs
   crap       filter QUIT, MODE, KICK and PONG
   all        everything listed above

Q: How do i ignore a channel?
A: /cig #channel or /cig for current chan.
   /tig to remove ignores.

Q: How do i enable/use auto_reconnect?
A: there are 3 different sets at the time of this writing to make the best
   use of reconnect.
   AUTO_RECONNECT is ON <-- settings are on/off on means it will attempt to
   reconnect you to another server if any during timeouts/kills etc.
   AUTO_RECONNECT_DELAY is 10 <--- time in seconds before retrying
   AUTO_RECONNECT_RETRIES is 3 <-- how many times to try before giving up

Q: why do the colours/font display properly?
A: see docs/NOTES for more detailed info, since amnesiac 2.0.x cvs 30 or
   higher, try /set_line_drawing 0, /set_line_drawing 1 or /fixterm (vga)
   /latin1(characters)

Q: does amnesiac support utf-8?
A: since epic5 1.0.1 release if libiconv(something else in linux) is installed
   and properly working, try /addmod utf8 and /save (this has been minimal
   tested by the amnesiac core scripters, we rely on reports from users of
   amnesiac for improving utf8 and utf8 related issues)

Q: How do i disable/toggle certain window notification?
A: /wnlevel none <-- disables notification
   /wnlevel publics,join,part <-- notify on public, join and parts

Q: how come amnesiac doesnt have a current working userlist?
A: bluntly put we dont care, however there is discussion about it
   from time to time, epic is a bit limited in terms of scripting something
   as complex such as a userlist, if anyone wish to write one or improve
   an existing userlist script in the wild, it may motivate some to look
   at and improve upon it, if the author has no issues with putting it
   under a license that is compatable with ours.

Q: how do you enable extended publics to show voice/op from users speaking
   in public channels?
A: /extpub on

Q: how can i make tabkey cycle nicks on blank tabs?
A: /config tab a on or /btab on

Q: how come amnesiac does not have a topicbar feature?
   [excerpts from TODO-BUGS below]
A add some topwin module, kreca has to start a discussion about some topwin
  script he might have permission for us to use/modify/rip ;)
  02.04.10 - due to the ugliness of toplines, and most of the scripters
  do not use/want topic modules, and the brave few who have attempted
  to do so, they all have their own little quirks, bugs, irritation,
  its not so much of doing, its how to actually properly design one,
  users who wants it, should check the epic5 source for topic scripts
  and load it, they do co-exist with amnesiac, they're however buggy.
