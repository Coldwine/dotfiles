Oki, did a bugfix to the old code
Can someone that _was_ affected by the bug please type /set_line_drawing 1
and check how the sbars look after that.
please switch between
/eval set_line_drawing 1;sbar 1;
and
/eval set_line_drawing 0;sbar 1;
to see if there is any difference

The above is another possible workaround for some terminals. seems to make
some europeans happy anyways, and thats what truly matters. ;p

## ansi/ibm437 hardcoding fonts/ugly looking etc..
-this is not a bug per se, it's just how the font handles ansi codes. 
 i do not know what fonts really support them, these are some of the
 things you can try if your theme/colors/ansi etc.. in the client looks
 screwed up, also for european/non western languages users. there is a
 /latin1 alias which should fix your terminal to fix your native language
 characters however you cannot use an ansi theme (in most cases)
 best to use the vanilla or epic theme. for non-western language encodings.
 /ibm437 will try and enable ansi-like encodings on your terminal/putty/
 xterm/whatever. it is best to have a font that supports this, one such
 font i do know that supports it for rxvt/aterm/etc.. is the vga11x19
 font, most people do not like this font as this is huge on small screens
 ie; 1024x768 or 15" or less monitors, it can be grabbed from 
 http://amnesiac.ircii.org/misc/
 there are also some other fonts in there as well which may or may not work.
 Note: artwiz-font types 'lime, smoothansi fonts works well'

## terminfo/termcap info.
-terminfo/termcap issues on FreeBSD not sure about DragonFly... possible fix
 ln -s /usr/compat/linux/usr/share/terminfo /usr/share/misc 
 and cross your fingers? - help from |Rain| (naturally i presume this
 requires the linux-compat libs installed.)

## multiserver in amnesiac.
-there has been some improvements since 1.1 release
 it's been tested and known to work, at the time of this writing mjoin does
 not support multiple servers. auto_reconnect is now back by popular demand.

## putty/other terminals etc..
in putty make sure you have a proper font, usually i use lucida console
however i have heard some complaints it will still not display ansi properly
even if one selects ansi/oem modes and set font translation character set to
'use font encoding' in that case try the terminal font. if all else fails
one can try /fixterm and or /latin1

[snippit from amn-faq.txt about utf-8]
Q: does amnesiac support utf-8?
A: since epic5 1.0.x release or better yet -cvs, if libiconv is installed
   and properly working, try /addmod utf8 and /save (this has been minimal
   tested by the amnesiac core scripters, we rely on reports from users of
   amnesiac for improving utf8 and utf8 related issues)
   'ldd /path/to/bin/epic5' to make sure it is linked to libiconv
   an output may look similar to this.

	/usr/local/bin/epic5:
        Start    End      Type Open Ref GrpRef Name

## additional information provided from 'outputhelp' straight from 
epic5/documentation source

## About gnu screen
People have often commented how they can get color and/or eight bit
characters working when running epic linked against ncurses and running
under gnu screen.

## wicked comment
Th:14:46|<@wicked> export LANG=C works for me mostly
Th:14:46|<@wicked> crtl+a+: c1 off  
Th:14:46|<@wicked> and
Th:14:46|<@wicked> crtl+a+: utf8 off off

All of this information was graciously provided by johnnie_doe@hotmail.com
(Starv@ircnet)

COLORS:
-------
To get colors under gnu screen, add these lines to your .screenrc file:

termcap  vt102 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
terminfo vt102 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'

If screen does not default to 'vt102', make sure you set TERM to vt102 before
you run epic.

EIGHT BIT CHARS:
---------------
If epic is linked against ncurses (it is by default), you can set some
ncurses options to make it accept eight bit characters more gracefully.
Add the following lines to your .inputrc:

set meta-flag on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

Then in EPIC, you may need to:
	/set high_bit_escape 0

If you are using GNU screen, make sure you have "defc1 off" in your 
screenrc file, because screen won't even display characters 128-159
with it on (and it is on by default). (from Ben Winslow, May 16, 1999)

DRAWING CHARACTERS:
-------------------
Fonts come with multiple character sets.  Usually there is a character
set with european national characters ("latin-1"), and another character 
set with box drawing characters ("vga").  These character sets are mutually
exclusive, and epic never forces you to use one or the other (unlike bx, or
amnesiac which forces you into vga mode unconditionally)

So if your font is in latin-1 mode, and your script wants vga mode, then you
will see lots of strange vowels and stuff.  Exit epic, run this command
at your shell:
	echo "X(U" | tr 'X' '\033'
and restart epic.

Good luck! Jeremy, Zak, Kreca
