 series to be for the first official release of epic5-stable(no plans on
 when the next release will be, but hopefully within the next two months
 provided we get a lot of testing done)
-added utf8, ask mongoose@errnet for info on how it works(irc.ircii.org)
 will probably document it more whenever i actually test it however he says
 it works its ugly i dont like it nor does kreca@, but sadly a lot of our
 userbase wants some sort of utf8 'support' NOTE: only for
 msgs,publics,notice, and some other hooks not everything will translate to
 utf8 look at amn/modules/utf8 for more information /utf8 to toggle on/off
 after one /addmod utf8 //zak

1.19.09
-make utf-8 module use iconv instead of homebrewn encoding //kreca

 /format 1. This makes it easier for themers to add custom whois definitions
 and testing them. //kreca

1.23.09
-Make scanformat and whoisformat work for amnesiac dirs that has a . in 
 their path. //kreca
-Convert all ibm437 that are represented in the portable graphics charachter
 set by using ^Echr^E instead. This makes a lot of the formats nicer when 
 using latin-1 or utf. 
 There are still a few characters left, specifically in a few sbars,
 bannerformats, awayformats and pubnotices. I havnt noticed any others,
 please report if you find any and I'll see if I can find a representation
