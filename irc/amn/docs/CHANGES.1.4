-fix _center alias to work again seems there's a bug or some change
 in xecho -w perhaps the usage has been removed in epic5. which explains
 why i didn't see the issue under epic4. //zak
-resync amc.load to use _center again //zak
-merge the above into -release.
-somewhat general start of the amnesiac-fuq Frequently Unanswered
Questions. spinoff of the old bitchx.fuq docs/amn-fuq.txt //zak 
-new snapshot.
1.2d r/1
-Add the beginnings of a real faq. //skullY
-fix some questionable skullyism's that forced me to make a release
 and found the questionable skullyism to be a problem and to have
 proof is just priceless (make latin1/ibm437/fixterm) work right again
 apparently he need's to read up on shell functions 101, perhaps maybe
 he was thinking people use !/bin/perl or just maybe he doesn't think ;(.
 //zak - merged to release.
-tyop in INSTALL - merged to release. //zak
-merge amn-fuq.txt, amn-faq.txt to release //zak

^^ added to -release //zak
-sync TODO-BUGS to reality //zak
-add stuff to TODO-BUGS //zak
-fixup the multiple /format inconsistencies found and done by Alien88
 thanks! //zak
-start of the proper way of using the ^on yell to suppress on what we really
 want to suppress. it got removed somehow i presume skullY forgot to sync
 before commit! //zak
-sync TODO-BUGS to reality. //zak
-bump snaprelease to r/2 //zak
-remove the /rel cruft again as we have our /relm -l and friends working
 i do not know why these are being recommitted *grumble* //zak
-add new ASK-KEY to /about and amn-fuq.txt amn-faq.txt done by
 xavier many thanks! //zak
-update TODO-BUGS //zak
-silence another yell we don't care about //zak

 would cause complications so use /trickle. ;) //zak

10.23.05
-add format_whois_ident for lame ircd's i.e bahamut //zak
-silence another annoying yell. //zak

10.26.05
-Fix all the scan.m garbage. I don't think that /scan should do anything
 but call /names ($C|$*), but kreca says no leave that so he can fix that 
 part. //skullY
-Big cleanup to scan.m, make /sco /scv /scn /scan on ^366 all use the same 
 alias to print scans. Get rid of the redundant formats
 format_scan_onjoin_nicks_border and format_scan_onjoin_nicks.

-toss out the fsckgin@!#!@ array. created a array directory for arrays
 of various types in files, this is a bit cleaner imho, and much easier
 for one to fine when they need to tweak or fsck something up. maybe
 this will make some of the less experienced be more motivated to take
 on some new format tasks and the like. //zak
-sync UPGRADE to reality. //zak
-fix up /save a bit better with correct alignment with skullY messed up
 with his xecho skullYism's. bad skullY! //zak
