This doc will kinda try to explain on how one can customize and or make
a new sbar, and be able to hook it into the tree.
as some may have noticed epic5 has a bunch of /set status_user*
to make use of it, for example if you want a shortend var for
how many ops/nonops are in your channel on the statbar one may do something
like this.
/set status_user2 $#chops()
/set status_user3 $#nochops()

to copy a simplified/modified example from statbar 11
/set status_format %T [win:%R] +%*%=%@%N%#%S%H%B%Q%A%C%+%I%O%F%L
/set status_format2 (ops:%2) (non:%3)

the %number points to whatever value is set into status_user2 and 3
for some more of the common values(note: just because you put lets say a %Q
for query it does not mean it may/may not work because it may/may not
require a /set status_query value one should look at stats/stat.11
for a simple example.

our own amnesiac custom variables. if one wants to customized their own
version of status_user* you should probably use 12 or higher as to not
conflict with the primary client values.
status_user2 $#chops() <-- total number of ops in a chan %2
status_user3 $#nochops() <-- total number of nonops in a chan %3
status_user4 $#pattern(*+* $channel()) <-- total voice in a chan %4
status_user7 $#pattern(* $channel()) <-- total of users in a chan %7

@windowdoubles=[on] <-- this means that the statbar will always use double
formats aka /set status_format and status_format2

after one is seemingly happy you may edit the amn/core/sbar.m file
from a couple of lines down from the top
change the @ sbar.max = 15 <-- the value is 15 as the time of this writing
lets say you just made the 16th sbar change the value to 16 and put your
newly modified sbar in amn/stats as stats.16, reload the script and /sbar 16
should take effect. and of course we welcome any new sbar if they look
ok, preferably only 1 format not double format statbars at this time.

Some other stat variables.
Taken from epicsols page.

%A	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_AWAY)
	This expands when you are AWAY.  If you are connected to only
	one server, this appears in the current window.  If you are
	connected to multiple servers, this appears in all windows.

%B	(SET STATUS_HOLD_LINES, wrapper)
	This expands if you have lines in your scrollback that you have 
	never seen ("held lines").  This sub-expansion value is the number
	of lines that you have never seen.  It is updated every /WINDOW 
	HOLD_INTERVAL lines.

%C	(SET STATUS_CHANNEL, wrapper)
	This expands when you are on a channel.  The sub-expansion value is
	the current channel name:
        * But if /SET HIDE_PRIVATE_CHANNELS is ON, and the channel mode
	includes +p or +s, "*private*" is used instead.
        * But if /SET CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH is > 0, and the channel name is
	longer than this value, it is chopped off to this length.

%D	(CURRENT)
	This expands to information about your current file transfer when
	you have a DCC SEND or DCC GET in progress, and when the window's 
	level includes DCC, or if this is the current input window and 
	/SET CURRENT_WINDOW_LEVEL includes DCC.

%{1}D
	This expands to information about your current file transfer when you
	have a DCC SEND or DCC GET in progress.  It unconditionally appears
	in every window.

%F	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_NOTIFY, wrapper)
	If you /WINDOW NOTIFY ON,  a window, then hide it, and output occurs
	to one of the levels in the hidden window's /WINDOW NOTIFY_LEVEL,
	the window will "notify" you that it has output.  The sub-expansion
	value is a comma-separated list of the window refnums that are 
	"notifying".

%{1}F   (CURRENT, SET STATUS_NOTIFY, wrapper)
	Just like %F, this gives you a list of notifying hidden windows,
	but if the window has a name, the name is used instead of its
	refnum.

%H	(SET STATUS_HOLD)
	This expands if you have lines in your scrollback that you have
	never seen ("held lines").

%I	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_INSERT)
	This expands when /SET INSERT_MODE is ON.

%K	(SET STATUS_SCROLLBACK)
	This expands when you are browsing the scrollback in this window.
	It can be helpful to use this because any new output to your window
	is "held" when you are in scrollback mode, and this gives you a
	visual clue that you haven't existed scrollback mode yet.

%{1}K
	This expands when you are browsing the scrollback in this window.
	It expands to "(Scroll: <num1> of <num2>)" where <num1> is how far 
	the top of your display is from the bottom of the scrollback buffer 
	(including any lines being held), and <num2> is how many lines total 
	are in your scrollback buffer (including any lines being held).

%L	(SET STATUS_CPU_SAVER, wrapper)
	This expands when you are in CPU SAVER mode.  The sub-expansion
	value is the literal string "CPU".

%M	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_MAIL, wrapper)
	This expands whenever /SET MAIL is not 0 and you have mail in 
	your inbox.  EPIC only supports mbox right now.  If /SET MAIL is 1,
	the sub-expression value is the empty string.  If /SET MAIL is 2,
	the sub-expression value is the number of emails in your inbox.

%N	(SET STATUS_NICKNAME, wrapper)
	This always expands.  The sub-expansion value is the nickname you
	are using on the window's server.  If the window is not connected
	to a server, the sub-expansion value is "<invalid server>".  If the
	window is connected to a disconnected server, the sub-expansion 
	value is "<not registered yet>".

%O	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_OVERWRITE)
	This expands when /SET INSERT_MODE is OFF.

%P
	This is an expando which is used by the developers to display 
	debugging information without doing any screen output.  There is
	no point in documenting it since it changes frequently.

%Q	(SET STATUS_QUERY, wrapper)
	This expands whenever you have a QUERY in this window.  The
	sub-expansion value is target you are querying.

%R
	This always expands to the window's name, if it has one, and to
	the window's refnum, if it does not have a name.

%{1}R
	This always expands to the window's refnum.

%S	(SET STATUS_SERVER, wrapper)
	This expands when you are connected to no servers, or when you 
	are connected to more than one server.  If the window is not
	connected to a server, it expands to "No Server".  The sub-expansion
	value is the first segment (portions of the name separated by dots)
	of our name for the server (what you supplied to the /SERVER command 
	or put in your server list).  If the name of the server is an IP
	address, then the sub-expression value is the IP address.  If the
	first segment of the server's name starts with "irc", then the
	second segment of the server's name is used.  If the name of the server 
	is more than 60 characters, it is chopped off at 60 characters.  As an
	example, if you are connected to "irc.choomba.com", then %S is 
	"choomba", and if you are connected to "192.168.1.101" then %S is
	"192.168.1.101" and if you are connected to "zen.buddha.com" then
	%S is "zen".  I hope this makes sense!

%{1}S   (SET STATUS_SERVER, wrapper)
	This is just like %S, but it appears in all windows, even when
	you are connected to just one server.

%{2}S	(SET STATUS_SERVER, wrapper)
	This is just like %{1}S, but the sub-expansion value is the full
	name of the server, and is not chopped up like %S.

%T	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_CLOCK, wrapper)
	This expands if /SET CLOCK is ON.  The sub-expansion value is 
	the current time formatted with strftime() using /SET CLOCK_FORMAT.
	If /SET CLOCK_FORMAT is unset, and /SET CLOCK_24HOUR is ON, then
	the time will be shown in 24 hour time, otherwise it will be shown 
	in 12 hour (imperial) time.

%{1}T
	This expands to the string "TEST".  If you don't see this on the
	status bar when you use this expando, your epic version doesn't
	support status expando maps.

%V	(CURRENT)
	This expands to the client's version string ($V)

%W
	This expands if there is more than one window on the screen, and 
	this window is the current input window.  This expando should be
	used as a visual cue that this window is the current input window
	when you are using a split screen.

%#	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_UMODE, wrapper)
	This expands when you have set a user mode on the window's server.
	It alawys expands if you are connected to more than one server.  It 
	does not expand if you are not connected to a server in this window.
	The sub-expansion value is the user mode for this server.

%%
	This expands to the literal string "%".  This is necessary for when
	you want to put a % in your status bar.

%*	(CURRENT, SET STATUS_OPER)
	This expands when you are an irc operator.  It always expands if you
	are connected to more than one server.

%+	(SET STATUS_MODE, wrapper)
	This expands when you are on a channel that has a channel mode.
	The sub-expansion value is the current channel's mode.

%{1}+ 	(SET STATUS_MODE, wrapper)
	This expands when you are on a channel.  If the current channel 
	does not have a mode set, the sub-expansion value is the empty
	string. Otherwise, the sub-expansion value is the current channel's 
	mode.

%.	(/WINDOW STATUS_SPECIAL)
	This expands when you have set a value for /WINDOW STATUS_SPECIAL.

%=	(SET STATUS_VOICE)
	This expands when you are a channel voice for the current channel.
	This does not expand when you are a channel operator for the 
	current channel.

%@	(SET STATUS_CHANOP or SET STATUS_HALFOP)
	This expands when to SET STATUS_CHANOP when you are are a channel
	operator for the current channel.  Otherwise, it expands to SET 
	STATUS_HALFOP when you are a half-channel-operator ("helper" on 
	some servers) for the current channel.

%|	(SET STATUS_SSL_ON or SET STATUS_SSL_OFF)
	This expands to SET STATUS_SSL_ON when the window's server
	connection is using SSL encryption.  Otherwise, it expands to SET
	STATUS_SSL_OFF.

   %U	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER)
   %X	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER1)
   %Y	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER2)
   %Z	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER3)
   %0	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER)
   %1	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER1)
   ... (%2, %3, %4, %5, %6, %7, %8) ...
   %9	 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER9)
   %{1}0 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER10)
   ... (%{1}1, %{1}2, %{1}2, %{1}3, %{1}4, %{1}5, %{1}6, %{1}7, %{1}8) ...
   %{1}9 (CURRENT, SET STATUS_USER19)
   %{2}0 (SET STATUS_USER20)
   ... (%{2}1, %{2}2, %{2}2, %{2}3, %{2}4, %{2}5, %{2}6, %{2}7, %{2}8) ...
   %{2}9 (SET STATUS_USER29)
   %{3}0 (SET STATUS_USER30)
   ... (%{3}1, %{3}2, %{3}2, %{3}3, %{3}4, %{3}5, %{3}6, %{3}7, %{3}8) ...
   %{3}9 (SET STATUS_USER39)
	These always expand.
