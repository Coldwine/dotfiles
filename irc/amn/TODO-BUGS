Amnesiac TODO/BUGS/Projects/Procrastinating list.

Rewrite Section:

This is some notes from hop on stuff we should look at rewriting.

<hop> in serverlist.m, i'd love to know why you're torturing the poor FULLDESC
      return value like that. ;-)
<hop> if the return value isn't usable, i'd rather fix the return value than
      require you to murder it.
<hop> so there is a $serverctl(READ_FILE filename)
<hop> and if you write all of the $serverctl(GET <refnum> FULLDESC) to that
      file, it'll Just Work(tm).
-----
<hop> $N is *never* what you think it is.
<hop> $servernick() is what you should use
-----
<hop> btw, the same deal with $C  -- $C is the current input window's current
      channel.  what you want is $winchan($serverwin())
-----
<hop> 1) You can create your own output levels with $levelctl()
<hop> http://epicsol.org/help/levelctl
<hop> ie, @levelctl(ADD bleh);/xecho -l bleh HAHAHAH!                           
-----
<hop>  /server irc.foo.com:pr=v6
<hop> or /server ssl-irc.foo.com:type=irc-ssl
-----
<hop> you should begin planning for elimiating every use of /eval everywhere    
<hop> if you need to double-expand strings, use the ** math operator            
<hop> @ foo = 'this is a string with $var in it'                                
<hop> @ var = "one"                                                             
<hop> @ val1 = **foo                                                            
<hop> @ var = "two"                                                             
<hop> @ val2 == **foo                                                           
<hop> val1 -> "this is a string with one in it"  val2 -> "this is a string
      with two in it"

Meaning of flags:
! = fixed/added stuff
+ = changed stuff, uncertain if complete.
@ = requests/votes
$ = knownbug.
? = undecided/closed votes.

## low priority knownbugs.
$ \ doesn't work well in tab, \nick\ in channel breaks causes problems..
^^ fixed? or still broken? //zak

$ Supposedly texp will break under certain circumstances <-- vague 
  kreca motherland speak, a little clarification here would 
  be nice //zak

$ userlist is buggy/has been having issues for years it's really not a
  priority for us but we may work on it soon. <- 02.03.10, eh mon, we
  love to talk about it, it comes up almost every time i come on irc,
  2015, it will be done in 2015. //zak
  addenum to the above, flags aor */* however does work, for auto-ops
  just everything else ctcp etc is broken.

$ serverlist module is actually incomplete, kreca says he will finish it
  timeline unknown. - year 2014 by my prediction if IRC still exists. ;p
  //zak

## high priority knownbugs.
NONE KNOWN

## high priority todo. (stuff that needs to done before upcoming release)
@ we have too many bindings for dcc, perhaps we could set some sort of cycle
  for chat/accept/send, as i highly doubt more than one person would send
  some sort of dcc request at once in most cases, ie; use ctrl-t to accept
  both chat/files and ctrl-r to reject both chat/files? something to look
  into? 03.12.10 no interest?, perhaps to look into after our release //zak

@ cleanup oper module/rewrite portions/allow for more toggability of 
  some things alien88 likes blocked that others may too.
  we should discuss things among different admins/opers we know in some
  temp irc channel //zak (work in progress) 02.04.10 - recent work of
  interest in improving our oper functonality has started up somewhat
  again, however it would be nice if opers big/small/medium networks
  of this script would stop by and ask what they would like to see or
  adjusted,removed if anything, feel free to drop us an e-mail even.
  (will evualuate after our real-first release) so we can fuck up so
  many cleanups while the current cvs is pretty stable/mature.

## lower priority requests/todo.
@ Finish server list module, assigned to kreca (kreca check UPDATES)
  ^ Still incomplete as of 02.03.10 marking the date/year down should
   speed up kreca's slackness or maybe not //zak

@ Start assigning more sane hook numerics, they're all over the place
  which is something we pretty much inherited from oblivion. //zak

@ We need to fix the getusers handling, hell it needs an overhaul, any
  takers? (some slight improvement in the past few months) 03.12.10 //zak

@ add some topwin module, kreca has to start a discussion about some topwin
  script he might have permission for us to use/modify/rip ;)
  02.04.10 - due to the ugliness of toplines, and most of the scripters
  do not use/want topic modules, and the brave few who have attempted
  to do so, they all have their own little quirks, bugs, irritation,
  its not so much of doing, its how to actually properly design one,
  users who wants it, should check the epic5 source for topic scripts
  and load it, they do co-exist with amnesiac, they're however buggy.

@ make orignick use ISON functionality.. -Rylan
  02.04.10 - i honestly think i like the idea of this however i
  forget the reason behind why we should use this other than,
  hijacking nicks quicker?, ISON functionality of epic is something
  not well understood for me //zak

@ Add a way to match the ban/invite execption list against the current
  users in a channel. Requested by Tilt. 10.04.10 i can totally see
  this happening within the next decade, i like the concept, however
  i can see this taking some time if someone even succeeded in scripting
  up that there are going to be a lot of complicated bugs, unforseen
  bugs cropping up over time, unless by chance someone else has
  some actual draft of how this could be implimented safely. //zak


## Procrastinated requests.
@ add support to bwk to allow usage of wildcards.
  - cool to have but hrm again what the benefit of the time
    to do this? sure it may be 5 mins but 5 mins is a lot of
    minutes for someone with a lack of time //zak

@ fixdouble/fixwin or equiv for doublestats
  - Note sure what the reason for this or why someone please
    start documenting more on TODO-BUGS on what is what thanks. //zak

## bugs fixed. / projects done.
! 05.12.10
 convert modules to the PF-Loader 02.04.10 see docs/PF-TODO
 All has finally been converted over to PF-L, cept for modules/services
 which isnt exactly of importance at this time, only took us 4 years! //zak

! 05.12.10
  /format 1, doesnt output the proper whois parses ircname/away mixup
  fixed better than it was before and looks better, not perfect but i'll
  settle for the cosmetic adjustment compared to our previous output //zak

! 05.12.10
  clonechecking broken
  -seems like it got missing/broken from the netsplit.m merge into
   core somehow, and some genius tried to make a duplicate hook
   which would not trigger regardless. now fixed! //zak

! 03.15.10 
  blankmsg tabkey does not save settings. (variable missing?) 
  -missing some stupid pf-loading crap for brokeness //zak

! 03.15.10
  /ub nick is broken, over further debugging - /ub nick /bans will also break.
  -fixed by kreca in previous commit(yesterday) //kreca

02.04.10
! more documentation need some updating?
  we have probably extensively documented more things in amnesiac
  more than any other irc script in history im sure, they may not
  all be in the client helpfiles itself, users of amn please to
  check out amn/docs for help as well before assuming amnesiac
  has a bug, or questions that may NOT be documented on client side
  due to in verbatim, ergo it goes in amn/docs though i admit there
  are some that still needs tweaking progress has been made //zak

02.03.10
! finish up or scrap the adcc module, i really hate to touch this myself
  i have never heard of a request for this module nor have i heard a single
  complaint about it working or not working perhaps a vote?
  @skullY I vote remove. If they need this they can run an eggdrop.
  gone for some time now i beleive, i forget how long, dont care, me
  happy //zak

01.23.10
! protect module is borked, fix? remove?
  @skullY I vote remove, Metoo, dead,gone junk useless not even pasture
  worthy //zak
  
2.13.08 - i beleive this has been done about a year ago kreca forgot to
	  update the file as usual. //zak
! Get some variables from numeric 005 so we can finetune some displays?
  EG, get nick length so we can have formatted publics and /who with proper
  output?

2.13.08 - finally got around to doing it /bhelp for info //zak
! add bans help documentation

1.24.08 - seems to work fine, let us know if any problems.
! add possible dcc_ports toggability, somewhat based off epic5/scripts.
   let me or kreca know if it works/causes problems/whatnot //zak
   (still untested for me really)

1.12.08 it's been set for default_realname/user, -snapshot is more for
	-cvs epic anyways. (were not adding backwards compat)
! fixup /set realname for default_realname and default_user should we
  if < ver, or break compatability? i vote for if < somever when it was
  added then do the old way of set realname.

1.31.07
! mmatrix module, /addword foobar #chan will not ban and kick user, just kick
  ^^ fixed prolly about a month or two ago //zak

10.21.06 - fixed by kreca 'getuhost' issue in alias.m -Rylan
! /ign seems to have interesting issues, recursion?? /ign foo-bar(nonexistent
  nick) spews Cannot pop operand: no more operands, looks like there's some
  hack to suppress even more errors a la ^?; math parser issue? -Rylan

9.14.06 seems to work fine, hopefully some will like this feature //zak
! make usage of $encode() for basic 'encryption' for awaylogs or some other
  new function that has yet to be investigated.

7.10.06 //skullY
! =nick= bug: if you use /msg nic<tab> and their nick ends in a \
  =nick= it prefixes it with another \, so it'll be nick\\

8/7/05 doesn't look like this is needed move to here votes closed. //zak
- maybe? for - glines...
  <@skullY> you could if ([$0]==[y] || [$0]==[yes]) //vote?

Last but not least, dont forget to report any unsurprising bugs no matter
how trivial they may appear, if you think something is a bug, please let
us know.
