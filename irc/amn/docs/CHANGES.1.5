for further CHANGES info please read docs/CHANGES.rel.

5.14.06
-synch docs for development 1.4d(snapshots) and version.

5.22.06
-redo the mjoin module. It now takes a window number as argument so you have
 full control on what window it will be bound to. This means the mjoin config
 is gone and backwards compability for saved channel lists are gone too.
 //kreca

5.24.06
-comment out forced dcc_timeout in core/compat.m no kreca this is clearly
 still not right, and probably should have not been in the -release
 ppl who claim about dcc chats closing in our previous release for no real
 reasons do /set dcc_timeout 0 and /save it should solve the issue until
 a real fix comes along, please investigate into this. it may be an epic
 bug i do not know.

5.28.06
-add /rflush (flushes out /relm /relsm /paste etc..) buffer. //zak
-add /reld /reldm (dcc chat/sent relay) functionality //zak
-new /config output "relay" for relay buffering as some seems to like
 adjusting the the values involving 2 new shortcut cmd's /inbuf /outbuf
 one should however avoid arbitraily large values as interesting things could
 possibly happen.
-slight cosmetic output format in /relm /relsm /relw etc.) deansify //zak
-add wording of /staynick to cancel when one does /orignick //zak
-increment minor snapver //zak
-sync epic docs to reality. //zak
-the previous /dlog functionality only logged dcc attempts, now it actually 
 logs dcc_msgs when one is set away and /dlog is turned on.
-added timestamps for dcc connect() close(), NOTE: you must
 rm -rf ~/.amn/.a.fsetsave if you are upgrading. //zak
-fix kickform 1 from displaying double )) when someone is kicked
 noticed by klepto. //zak
-add klepto to greets //zak
-force-set a random quit_message when one connects to a server, to prevent
 non-evaluated quit messages when the client crashes/get killed/power outage
 ie; user quit, reason $tolower($J) - $randread($(loadpath)quit.reasons)
 this should also help with people reporting this as a bug. //zak
-slight change in xy module of typos/deletion/corrections with help from
 nathan. //zak

 nathan, many thanks! //zak

-New internal structure in modules system, _modinfo structure
 with information about savefiles, loadcmd and savecmd.
 This make /save able to save module information aswell instead of
 the user having to do so manually.
 In the future this can be extended to contain sets.default etc, so
 we can switch all our config vars to use addset instead of our homebrewn
 system. //kreca

 attempts to ban you and kick the offender, cleaned up and hopefully it
 works right now. //zak

-away logging is now 'encrypted' with simple algo using $encode/$decode
