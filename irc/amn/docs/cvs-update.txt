Amnesiac Update using CVS

- The first time you want to update amnesiac with CVS, you need to go 
  to the top level directory and log into the CVS server:
  $ cd ~/amn
  $ cvs login
  Logging in to :pserver:anoncvs@prbh.org:2401/home/cvs/repository
  CVS password: anoncvs
  
  Finally, to update amnesiac just type:
  $ cvs -q up -Pd

- or to just grab a fresh copy of amnesiac
  cvs -q get -P amn (in the directory you wish to store amn) common
  users can execute from ~/  (user home directory)

NOTE: if you get a pass error, and or if you are running cvs for the
      first time on a particular account, you may need to touch ~/.cvspass
      if you run into errors.
