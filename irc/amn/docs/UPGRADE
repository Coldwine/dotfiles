NOTE: most of this information here is for referece purposes, for some brave
amnesiac users who still have yet to upgrade in the past 3+ years. you   
should always back up your ~/.amn savefile directory before attempting to
upgrade in case things breaks, or needs to be merged manually.

NOTE: added a new CAVEAT for updating to latest amnesiac 2.0.1(cvs 40+)
Most important from 2.0.x to 2.0.2 is to purge your ~/amn dir and recvs,
unless you know how to force update to head via cvs then cvs -q up -Pd,
then pray. cause of too many file deletion/changes/modifications/renames
etc. so make sure your amnesiac dir actually get's rid of things that
is now in the attic on the cvs side of things, next most important,
make sure to unload modules that no longer exist, or possibly broken/
nonexistent etc. /listmod and /vmod should help determine what's avail
More info near the bottom of this upgrade file. marked "NEW"

WARNING: the following may screw up your script, remove precious savefiles or
render the client unusable, you have been warned.

## /adump info and why.
/adump is more of a scripters command, there are various usages of this cmd,
i.e when playing with /sets and or formats/sbars etc.. something went wrong
/adump will dump and reload/configure the script from it's last /save position
(basically last working config before it got messed up)

## Upgrading from 1.1x 1.2x to 1.3d 1.4d
rm -rf /path/to/amn
tar zxf newver.tgz (will normally uncompress in home dir, or current dir)
or if one wishes to specify where to put amn
tar zxf newver.tgz -C /path/to/where/you/want/it
/adump (in client)

## upgrading to snapshots
wget http://amnesiac.ircii.org/ac-snap.tgz
rm -rf /path/to/amn
tar zxf ac-snap.tgz (this will store in current dir usually home as amn)
or to specify where to put amn.
tar zxf ac-snap.tgz -C /path/to/preferred/place
/adump (in client)

## AS of 1.5.x release we are now using a public cvs server.
NOTE: please see docs/cvs-update.txt for more information.

most of you should be able to update easily after grabbing the latest
release and or snapshot, cd /path/to/your/amn && cvs up -Pd 
this will require you to have cvs installed naturally.

NOTE: in some cases you may have to rm -rf ~/.amn in cases we may have
broke backwards compatability with some things.
ie; banwordkick(mmatrix module) and format settings(core client)
^^ information is outdated. its strictly a reference for upgrading amnesiac
from 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 to 1.5 for example.

NEW - 05.12.10
-because of so many changes to our object layout, and file deletion/moving
/renames, etc, you MUST rm -rf ~/amn if you are not upgrading from CVS,
else follow the CVS-UPDATE information how to update via CVS.

upgrading from 1.x 2.0 -> 2.0.1+(commit id 40+)
use cvs, and or rm -rf ~/amn
tar zxf ac-snap.tgz
/adump if you're brave, if using older epic5 it may not even load.
